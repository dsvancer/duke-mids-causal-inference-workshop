    "## About the Workshop\n",
    "Causal inference is a fundamental problem in many fields, including economics, epidemiology, and social sciences, where understanding the causal relationships between variables is crucial for informed decision-making. In many cases, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are not feasible or ethical, and researchers must rely on observational data to draw causal conclusions. However, observational data are often confounded by unmeasured variables, making it challenging to separate causal from non-causal relationships. In this training, we will introduce the potential outcomes framework, which provides a foundation for causal inference. We will then discuss several popular methods for estimating causal effects, including propensity score matching, inverse propensity scoring, double machine learning, TMLE, and uplift modeling. These methods aim to remove confounding bias and identify the causal effect of a treatment or intervention on an outcome variable. We will discuss the strengths and limitations of each method, as well as provide hands-on training to their applications in real-world scenarios.\n",

    "## Applied Coding Sessions\n",
    "This workshop includes several applied coding sessions where we demonstrate causal modeling techniques with Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover the following high-level tops:\n",
    "- Potential outcomes framework and data generating processes\n",
    "- Building and evaluating ML models in `scikit-learn`\n",
    "- Estimating Average Treatment Effects (ATE) with propensity score matching, Double ML, and targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE)\n",
